# Spoke
=========

Spoke is a MATLAB app for live display of neural 
data from high-channel-count recording systems. It offers multiple experimenter-optimized display modes based on data reduction of high-channel-count data streams. It is designed around the Whisper extracellular recording system developed at HHMI/Janelia Research Campus in the [APIG lab of Tim Harris](https://www.janelia.org/lab/harris-lab-apig) and its accompanying [SpikeGLX] (https://github.com/billkarsh/SpikeGLX) neural recording software.

Spoke is developed & maintained by the APIG Lab at HHMI/Janelia Research Campus.
