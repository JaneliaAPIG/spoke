[Spoke](https://github.com/jamesjun/spoke) is a MATLAB app for live display of neural 
spike data obtained using the [SpikeGLX] (https://github.com/billkarsh/SpikeGLX) neural 
recording software. Spoke & SpikeGLX are compatible with the Whisper extracellular recording 
system developed at HHMI/Janelia Research Campus in the [APIG lab of Tim Harris](https://www.janelia.org/lab/harris-lab-apig). 

Spoke is developed/maintained by the APIG Lab at HHMI/Janelia Research Campus.

### System Requirements
